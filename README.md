# MortgageCalculator by Sean Kelley

This application allows the user to enter mortgage information in and it loads the monthly payment as well as a mortgage amortization schedule.

This project utilizes C# as well as windows forms and is comprised of a class library that holds all the classes to generate the mortgage and connect to the database,
a windows forms project that creates the mortgage calculator form, and a class library that acts as a unit testing projecct, which tests the methods that calculate
the mortgage.

*Before running the program make sure to add the path for MortgageDB.db into the connection string in App.config*
